This repository contains the GSP Technical Manual for Soil Sampling Design based on the R package [clhs](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/clhs/index.html) and using the procedures shown in [@Malone].

The original data samples can be found in this [repository](https://bitbucket.org/brendo1001/clhc_sampling/src/master/), where  you can find all procedures and scripts to develop a sampling design using you own datasets.
