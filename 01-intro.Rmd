# Introduction 

Understanding the spatial distribution of soil properties is crucial for making informed decisions in various fields, from precision agriculture to environmental conservation. The success of soil mapping activities relies on the existence of proper data collated through meticulous soil sampling protocols. The spatial variation of soil properties across landscapes necessitates strategic planning to ensure representative and reliable data collection. 

In this manual, we explore the intricacies of soil sampling design, including the critical factors that influence the accuracy and effectiveness of soil data field sampling. We present examples of various sampling methods, ranging from traditional grid-based approaches to advanced statistical sampling strategies. We include methods for systematic, random and stratified sampling, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses in the context of DSM. We aim to provide researchers and practitioners with the knowledge necessary to select the most suitable approach for their specific objectives.



## Manual Structure

We use examples based on the data and scripts at [@Malone], which can be found at the [repository](https://bitbucket.org/brendo1001/clhc_sampling/src/master/).

We have used a common structure for file paths in the exercises. By default, the RStudio console points to the folder where the project is located. Thus, R scripts appear in the root of the working directory and data files are in a `'data/'` directory within the root, with `'.shp'` and `'.tif'` files located within the sub-folders `'data/shapes'` and `'data/rasters'` respectively. Following this recommendation simplifies the definition of paths and execution of the scripts. If users desire to change their storage paths, they have to properly adjust data paths in the R scripts.
